# Assignment 4 - Docker

## Overview

In this project, I worked with Docker to complete various tasks related to containerization, image management, and securing containers. The goal was to gain hands-on experience with Docker by building custom images, running containers, and managing persistent storage.

## Key Tasks
- **Install Docker Engine** and set up the environment.
- **Pull and list base images** from Docker Hub.
- **Run Docker containers** with custom configurations.
- **Create a custom Nginx image**, incorporating an `index.html` file.
- **Implement persistent storage** using bind-mounts and Docker volumes.
- **Run a container with constrained security settings**, using read-only root filesystems and dropping all capabilities.
- **Inspect container logs** for troubleshooting and optimization.

## Lessons Learned

- Gained experience in containerization, persistent storage, and Docker security practices.
- Learned how to efficiently work with Docker containers in a controlled, constrained environment.
- Improved troubleshooting skills by inspecting container logs to diagnose issues.
